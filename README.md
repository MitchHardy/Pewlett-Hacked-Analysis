# Pewlett-Hacked-Analysis

## Overview of Pewlett-Hacked-Analysis
### I have been asked to perform an analysis on the workforce at Pewlett Hackard which is increasingly aging. In order to accomplish this analysis, I identified the employees that are most likely to retire soon and sorted it by their titles. I also identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. I executed this task by using PostgreSQL. Below is a step by step walk through of the analysis.
- The Retirement Titles table is written and executed for employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955
- The Retirement Titles table is exported as retirement_titles.csv
- The Unique Titles table is written and executed for the employee number, first and last name, and most recent title
- The Unique Titles table is exported as unique_titles.csv
- The Retiring Titles table is written and executed for the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring
- The Retiring Titles table is exported as retiring_titles.csv

## Pewlett-Hacked-Analysis Results:
- In total there are 90,398 employees that are likely going to be retiring 
- Of the 90,398 employees that could retire soon, 45,397 or 50% of these employees are an engineer of some kind
- The most employees that are likely to retire fall under the staff title with a total of 32,452 people
- There are 1,940 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary:
